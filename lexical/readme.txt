Hi, there! Welcome to my how-to for my (currently unnamed) Designer Language Project!

Are you looking for the most well-organized, efficient, and rewarding programming language this turn of the century?
Well, Javascript is two doors down on the left.
But the point is you're here right now, so I get to tell you ALL about my language. Whether you want to or not.


(unnamed language) is based heavily off the basic C language, specifically C99. Yeah, I know, it's a little outdated, but it's pretty much the only one I know.

In addition, a lot of the foundation of my language stems from on Doctor John Lusth, who assigned me the project, and gave a very thorough template on how to create your very own deseigner language, and is generally pretty cool guy.

DIFFERENCES
	The majority of the syntax used for C99 will be used for (unnamed language). If it ain't broke, right? However, I did change some minor details. In regards to structs, selecting a variable within a struct will not use "->" to denote it; instead it will use ".". There's no particular reason for it, I just think it looks cooler. Also there's no "DO WHILE" loop. That was also confusing to me, and I'm not having it.

META: More difference will probably come up, I'm just mid-process right now.

HOW TO USE
	So since 99.23% of this code is built of the C99 language, a better question than "How do I use your code?" would be "How do I use C language?".
